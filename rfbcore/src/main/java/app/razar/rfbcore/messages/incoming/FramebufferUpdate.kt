/**
 * A framebuffer update consists of a sequence of rectangles of pixel data which the client should put into its framebuffer.
 * It is sent in response to a FramebufferUpdateRequest from the client. Note that there may be an indefinite period between
 * the FramebufferUpdateRequest and the FramebufferUpdate.
 *
 * No. of bytes 	Type 	[Value] 	Description
 * 1 	            U8 	    0 	        message-type
 * 1 	              	  	            padding
 * 2 	            U16 	  	        number-of-rectangles
 *
 * This is followed by number-of-rectangles rectangles of pixel data. Each rectangle consists of:
 * No. of bytes 	Type 	Description
 * 2 	            U16 	x-position
 * 2 	            U16 	y-position
 * 2 	            U16 	width
 * 2 	            U16 	height
 * 4 	            S32 	encoding-type
 *
 * followed by the pixel data in the specified encoding. See Encodings for the format of the data for each encoding and
 * Pseudo-encodings for the meaning of pseudo-encodings.
 *
 * Note that a framebuffer update marks a transition from one valid framebuffer state to another. That means that a single
 * update handles all received FramebufferUpdateRequest up to the point where the update is sent out.
 *
 * However, because there is no strong connection between a FramebufferUpdateRequest and a subsequent FramebufferUpdate,
 * a client that has more than one FramebufferUpdateRequest pending at any given time cannot be sure that it has
 * received all framebuffer updates.
 *
 * See the LastRect Pseudo-encoding for an extension to this message.
