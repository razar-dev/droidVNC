/**
 * FramebufferUpdateRequest
 *
 * Notifies the server that the client is interested in the area of the framebuffer
 * specified by x-position, y-position, width and height. The server usually responds
 * to a FramebufferUpdateRequest by sending a FramebufferUpdate. Note however that
 * a single FramebufferUpdate may be sent in reply to several FramebufferUpdateRequests.

 * The server assumes that the client keeps a copy of all parts of the framebuffer in
 * which it is interested. This means that normally the server only needs to send
 * incremental updates to the client.
 *
 * However, if for some reason the client has lost the contents of a particular area
 * which it needs, then the client sends a FramebufferUpdateRequest with incremental
 * set to zero (false). This requests that the server send the entire contents of the
 * specified area as soon as possible. The area will not be updated using the CopyRect
 * encoding.
 *
 * If the client has not lost any contents of the area in which it is interested,
 * then it sends a FramebufferUpdateRequest with incremental set to non-zero (true).
 * If and when there are changes to the specified area of the framebuffer, the server
 * will send a FramebufferUpdate. Note that there may be an indefinite period between
 * the FramebufferUpdateRequest and the FramebufferUpdate.
 *
 * In the case of a fast client, the client may want to regulate the rate at which
 * it sends incremental FramebufferUpdateRequests to avoid hogging the network.
 * No. of bytes 	Type 	[Value] 	Description
 * 1 	            U8 	    3 	        message-type
 * 1 	            U8 	  	            incremental
 * 2 	            U16 	  	        x-position
 * 2 	            U16 	  	        y-position
 * 2 	            U16 	  	        width
 * 2 	            U16 	  	        height
 *
 * A request for an area that partly falls outside the current framebuffer must be cropped
 * so that it fits within the framebuffer dimensions.
 *
 * Note that an empty area can still solicit a FramebufferUpdate even though that update
 * will only contain pseudo-encodings.
