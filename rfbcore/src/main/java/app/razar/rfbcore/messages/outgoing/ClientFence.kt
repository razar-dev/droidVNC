/**
 * A client supporting the Fence extension sends this to request a synchronisation of the data stream.
 * No. of bytes 	Type 	[Value] 	Description
 * 1 	            U8 	    248 	    message-type
 * 3 	  	  	                        padding
 * 4 	            U32 	  	        flags
 * 1 	            U8 	  	            length
 * length 	        U8 array 	  	    payload
 *
 * The flags byte informs the server if this is a new request, or a response to a server request sent earlier,
 * as well as what kind of synchronisation that is desired. The server should not delay the response
 * more than necessary, even if the synchronisation requirements would allow it.
 * Bit 	    Description
 * 0 	        BlockBefore
 * 1 	        BlockAfter
 * 2 	        SyncNext
 * 3-30 	    Currently unused
 * 31 	        Request
 *
 * The server should respond with a ServerFence with the Request bit cleared, as well as clearing any
 * bits it does not understand. The remaining bits should remain set in the response. This allows the
 * client to determine which flags the server supports when new ones are defined in the future.
 *
 * BlockBefore
 * All messages preceding this one must have finished processing and taken effect before the response is sent.
 * Messages following this one are unaffected and may be processed in any order the protocol permits,
 * even before the response is sent.
 *
 * BlockAfter
 * All messages following this one must not start processing until the response is sent.
 * Messages preceding this one are unaffected and may be processed in any order the protocol permits,
 * even being delayed until after the response is sent.
 *
 * SyncNext
 * The message following this one must be executed in an atomic manner so that anything preceding the
 * fence response must not be affected by the message, and anything following the fence response must
 * be affected by the message.
 *
 * Anything unaffected by the following message can be sent at any time the protocol permits.
 *
 * The primary purpose of this synchronisation is to allow safe usage of stream altering commands such
 * as SetPixelFormat, which would impose strict ordering on FramebufferUpdate messages even with
 * asynchrounous extensions such as the ContinuousUpdates Pseudo-encoding.
 *
 * If BlockAfter is also set then the interaction between the two flags can be ambiguous.
 * In this case we relax the requirement for BlockAfter and allow the following message
 * (the one made atomic by SyncNext) to be processed before a response is sent.
 * All messages after that first one are still subjected to the semantics of BlockAfter however.
 * The behaviour will be similar to the following series of messages:
 *
 * ClientFence with SyncNext
 * message made atomic
 * ClientFence with BlockAfter
 *
 * Request
 * Indicates that this is a new request and that a response is expected.
 * If this bit is cleared then this message is a response to an earlier request.
 *
 * The client can also include a chunk of data to differentiate between responses and to avoid keeping state.
 * This data is specified using length and payload. The size of this data is limited to 64 bytes in order
 * to minimise the disturbance to highly parallel clients and servers.
