/**
 * There are three stages to the protocol.  First is the
 * handshaking phase, the purpose of which is to agree upon the protocol
 * version and the type of security to be used.  The second stage is an
 * initialization phase where the client and server exchange ClientInit
 * and ServerInit messages.  The final stage is the normal protocol
 * interaction.  The client can send whichever messages it wants, and
 * may receive messages from the server as a result.  All these messages
 * begin with a message-type byte, followed by message-specific data.
