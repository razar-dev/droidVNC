/**
 *  PointerEvent
 *
 *  Indicates either pointer movement or a pointer button press or release. The pointer is now
 *  at (x-position, y-position), and the current state of buttons 1 to 8 are represented
 *  by bits 0 to 7 of button-mask respectively, 0 meaning up, 1 meaning down (pressed).
 *
 *  On a conventional mouse, buttons 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the left, middle and right buttons
 *  on the mouse. On a wheel mouse, each step of the wheel is represented by a press and release
 *  of a certain button. Button 4 means up, button 5 means down, button 6 means left and button 7 means right.
 *  No. of bytes 	Type 	[Value] 	Description
 *  1 	            U8 	    5 	        message-type
 *  1 	            U8 	  	            button-mask

 *  2 	            U16 	  	        y-position
 *
 *  The QEMU Pointer Motion Change Psuedo-encoding allows for the negotiation of an alternative
 *  interpretation for the x-position and y-position fields, as relative deltas.
