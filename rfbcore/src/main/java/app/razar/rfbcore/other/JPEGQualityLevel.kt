/**
 * Specifies the desired quality from the JPEG encoder. Encoding number
 * -23 implies high JPEG quality and -32 implies low JPEG quality.
 * Low quality can be useful in low bandwidth situations.
 * If the JPEG quality level is not specified, JpegCompression is not used in the Tight Encoding.
 *
 * The quality level concerns lossy compression and hence the setting is a tradeoff
 * between image quality and bandwidth. The specification defines neither what bandwidth
 * is required at a certain quality level nor what image quality you can expect.
 * The quality level is also just a hint to the server.
