/**
 * Specifies the desired compression level. Encoding number -247 implies high compression level,
 * -256 implies low compression level. Low compression level can be useful to get low latency
 * in medium to high bandwidth situations and high compression level can be useful in low bandwidth situations.
 *
 * The compression level concerns the general tradeoff between CPU time and bandwidth.
 * It is therefore probably difficult to define exact cut-off points for which compression levels
 * should be used for any given bandwidth. The compression level is just a hint for the server,
 * and there is no specification for what a specific compression level means.
 *
 * Most servers use this hint to control lossless compression algorithms as the tradeoff between
 * CPU time and bandwidth is obvious there. However it can also be used for other algorithms
 * where this tradeoff is relevant.
