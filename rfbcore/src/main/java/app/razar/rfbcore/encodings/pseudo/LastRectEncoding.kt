/**
 * A client which requests the LastRect pseudo-encoding is declaring
 * that it does not need the exact number of rectangles in a FramebufferUpdate message.
 * Instead, it will stop parsing when it reaches a LastRect rectangle.
 * A server may thus start transmitting the FramebufferUpdate message
 * before it knows exactly how many rectangles it is going to transmit,
 * and the server typically advertises this situation by saying that
 * it is going to send 65535 rectangles, but it then stops with a LastRect
 * instead of sending all of them. There is no further data associated
 * with the pseudo-rectangle.
