/**
 * Specifies the desired quality from the JPEG encoder. Encoding number -23 implies high JPEG quality
 * and -32 implies low JPEG quality. Low quality can be useful in low bandwidth situations.
 * If the JPEG quality level is not specified, JpegCompression is not used in the Tight Encoding.
 *
 * The quality level concerns lossy compression and hence the setting is a tradeoff between image
 * quality and bandwidth. The specification defines neither what bandwidth is required at a certain
 * quality level nor what image quality you can expect. The quality level is also just a hint to the server.
